Show all options for out of stock child products for configurable product

Defaut Magento 1 behaviour is to check at least 1 child product is saleable then it will show all child product options.
But you want to show all out of stock options to make existing and new customers.

If you install this extension you will see all out of stock options visible on frontend.

#### Upcoming feature:
Show cross line over swatches on page load on product view and product listing page
